#### Lab Question 1

```
Run styleLint.py in Codio.

  => What happens when the code is run? 
  => Can you modify this code for a more favourable outcome? 
  => What amendments have you made to the code?
```

#### Lab Question 2

```
pip install pylint
Run pylint on pylintTest.py

=> Review each of the code errors returned. 
=> Can you correct each of the errors identified by pylint? 
=> Before correcting the code errors, save the pylintTest.py file with a new name (it will be needed again in the next question).

#### Lab Question 3

```
pip install flake8
Run

flake8 
on pylintTest.py

=> Review the errors returned. In what way does this error message differ from the error message returned by pylint?
=> Run flake8 on metricTest.py. Can you correct each of the errors returned by flake8? What amendments have you made to the code?

#### Lab Question 5 (e-portfolio entry)

```
From Section 5 of the Firdaus et al (2014) reading, select a test technique from the following categories:

* Experience-based techniques
<br>
Discuss the scenario(s) in which each technique would be important to be used.
